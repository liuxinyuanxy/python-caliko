## python fast iterative solver for Inverse Kinematics

Is a conversion from [caliko](https://github.com/FedUni/caliko)

The usage is as same as caliko, but the name of classes and methods are changed to be more pythonic. Also, overload is not supported in python, so the method names are changed to be more descriptive.


[TODO]:

- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Implement visualization
